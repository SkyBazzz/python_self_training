This project is about my Python learning path.
It consists of different packages related to a particular part of the language/taken courses.

Each package has it's own main/app module to run and validate the result.
Input and Output directories

Before run any project do the following
```text
create virtual environment
```
Install dependencies
```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
